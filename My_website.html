                <p>
                    Hey there! <br>
                    My name is Noga, I'm 23 years old, I live in Israel (pretty close to Tel-Aviv).<br>
                    I used to study in an excelent class back in high-school,<br>
                    My majors were Physics and Chemistry.<br>
                    I'm currently considering my university major,<br>
                    I didn't choose yet,<br>
                    But I believe I will probably end up combining two majors because I can't<br>
                    make up my mind about a single one...😂<br>
                    I have a cute dog, her name is Luba and i love her very much🥰<br>
                </p>

                <h2> Work </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to work as a Technical support for one year at a startup company called "Captain's Eye".<br>
                    It wasn't exactly the ordenery kind of support,<br>
                    because a startup is usually a very small company (In our case - only 20 people),<br>
                    each one of us had to take upon himself the work of at least 2-3 people in a regular company!<br>
                    Therefore, I came across a verity of interesting stuff, and I got to expend my knowledge in lots of different areas.<br>

                <h2> Skills </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here is a list of the skills i have gained during the <br> year I worked for Captain's eye company:</li><br><br>
                        <li>Linux - UBUNTU</li>
                        <p> Most of the servers needed to have UBUNTU on them so our system could work proporly,<br>
                            therefore - I have worked almost 90% of the day on UBUNTU or powershell in order to access <br>
                            the systems on the vessels and fix or update the program according to the vessel's needs.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Bash and Shell scripting</li>
                        <p>
                            In order to make the installation department more usefull and quick,<br>
                            I have created automations in Bash that helped the team install the softwere more easily,<br>
                            and also documented the hardware in the Database.
                            All the day-to-day work had to be in the powershell or UBUNTU and therefore involved a lot of shell scripting.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Database (MongoDB)</li>
                        <p>
                            All the parameters of the vessels were documented and maintained through the Database,<br>
                            every vessel had its own page, and there was also a control page for all the vessles together,<br>
                            most of my work in the Database was to upload new CCTV cameras from the vessels into the Database,<br>
                            and to change parameters according to the needs of the vessel.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
                        <p>
                            All the vessels had to be connected to the cloud in order to function proporly,<br>
                            I had to ensure that every vessel had its own credential in order to access the cloud,<br>
                            I uplouded all my automations to the cloud so it will be easier to download them no matter <br>
                            where the vessel is currently sailing.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> VPN - Wiregaurd </li>
                        <p>
                            In order to prevent unwanted visitors or malicious malware inside the company servers,<br>
                            every vessel had its own Wiregaurd IP that you could access only after connecting to the VPN.<br>
                            I had to ensure that every vessel got its unique and accessible IP.<br>
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Domain name system (DNS)</li>
                        <p>
                            In order to make it easier to access every vessel,<br>
                            instead of writing the IP of the server every time, I connected between the IP <br>
                            of the server and the name of the vessel so it will be easier to access.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Cameras, Switches and Access points</li>
                        <p>
                            The company's system included Cameras, Switches and Access points that were connected <br>
                            to our servers. <br>
                            I have configured them before we sent them to the vessel,<br>
                            and after they arrived to the vessel - I made sure that I was able to see<br>
                            them online and added the Cameras to the Database so they will appear on the Website.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Docker </li>
                        <p>
                            In order to make sure that all the vessels have the latest updates of the softwere, <br>
                            we created containers for each and every different subject that the softwere involved. <br>
                            This way, it was easier to control the softwere on all the vessels together. <br>
                            I had to change docker compose and make sure the containers are up on the latest version. <br>
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Network configurations </li>
                        <p>
                            All the network configurations were made or at least checked by me, <br>
                            both on shore and on the vessels themselves.
                            I would access through the DNS or WG, or through teamviewer or RDP <br> in a case of a problem.
                        </p>
